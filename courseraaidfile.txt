I'm applying for financial aid because I can not afford it but I am willing to take this course because  it would be very helpful to  me and due to financial problem I am not able to enroll that's why I am applying for it .my family is already under student loan so I can not give them more trouble otherwise it would become hard for them, I am sure you understand this . If you will grant me  financial aid I would be very happy ,it would mean a lot  to me Moreover I consider it a great help because somewhere it will definitely benefit me in my career.Again I'm  requesting that plz give me financial aid therefore I can use this course as my learning medium to gain knowledge  and be more practical about it that how can I use it in real life.I am sure you will understand and I hope you would consider my financial Condition.

As I was looking for this course I ended up on Coursera because some of my friends who have enrolled and used it found it great . This course includes basics to advance. It also contains data structures which will definitely help me out. 
Other than that, after completing this course u would get a certificate from Coursera which I can put on my resume to make me look professional which further will help me to get picked by companies for placements. I take this course more than a course because I really like it and I'm eager to start this course.it definitely going to benefit me as this course python for everybody is a highly used language all over the world for example in data science, Artificial intelligence, and many more. By learning and Implementing it more and more  I could get placed in companies that need skilled python users.

I am not able to afford this as I am a student and unemployed but I want to  increase my knowledge
