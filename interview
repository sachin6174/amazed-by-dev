Code Completion (‚åÉ + Space): Use this shortcut to bring up code completion, which is essential for exploring APIs and saving time while typing code [1].
Moving Lines (‚å• + ‚åò + [ and ‚å• + ‚åò + ]): Easily move single lines or entire blocks of code around in your project, making code organization more efficient [1].
Delete Entire Line (‚åò + D): Quickly delete an entire line of code with this shortcut. You can customize the key binding for this command in Xcode settings [1].
Balance Indentation (‚åÉ + I): Use this shortcut to adjust the indentation of a line or a block of code. It's particularly useful when pasting code from external sources like Stack Overflow [1].
Going Back and Forth (‚åÉ + ‚åò + ‚Üê and ‚åÉ + ‚åò + ‚Üí): Easily navigate between different locations in your source code by going back and forth using these shortcuts [1].
Jump to Definition (‚åÉ + ‚åò + J or ‚åÉ + ‚åò + Click): When working with unfamiliar APIs or exploring codebases, use this shortcut to quickly jump to the definition of a symbol to understand its methods, properties, and inheritance hierarchy [1].
Find Selected Symbol in Workspace (‚áß + ‚åÉ + ‚åò + F): This shortcut helps you find all instances of a selected symbol in your project, providing insights into its usage and allowing for easier refactoring [1].
Find Call Hierarchy (‚áß + ‚åÉ + ‚åò + H): Use this shortcut to view the call hierarchy of a selected method. It displays all the places in your codebase where the method is called, helping you understand its usage [1].
Open Quickly (‚áß + ‚åò + O): This powerful shortcut allows you to quickly navigate to any source location in your project or workspace by typing the name of the class, function, or other symbols [1].
Jump to Line (‚åò + L): Easily navigate to a specific line in the current file by using this shortcut [1].
Document Outline (‚åÉ + 6 or ‚åò + hovering the minimap): Use ‚åÉ + 6 to access a drop-down menu with all the symbols in the current source file. Hovering over the minimap while pressing ‚åò displays a float with the name of the symbol under the cursor [1].
Toggle Canvas / SwiftUI Preview (‚å• + ‚åò + ‚Ü©): This shortcut allows you to toggle the live preview of your SwiftUI code in Xcode's Canvas. It helps you quickly visualize changes to your UI without launching the application [1].
Toggle Views: Xcode has three main areas surrounding the code editor that can be toggled to maximize editing space or display contextual information:
Toggle Navigator (‚åò + 0): Show or hide the Navigator area on the left side [1].
Toggle Inspectors (‚åò + ‚å• + 0): Show or hide the Inspectors area on the right side [1].
Toggle Debug area (‚áß + ‚åò + Y): Show or hide the Debug area at the bottom [1].
These shortcuts can significantly enhance your productivity and speed up your coding process in Xcode. Feel free to explore and experiment with them to find the ones that work best for you!
