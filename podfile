This error message typically occurs when the pod command is not installed on your system or it is not in your system's PATH.
If you are using macOS and have installed CocoaPods using Homebrew, you can try running the following command to add the CocoaPods executable to your PATH:
Copy Code
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

Then close and reopen your terminal window for the changes to take effect.
If you have not installed CocoaPods yet, you can install it by running the following command:
Copy Code
sudo gem install cocoapods
Or brew install cocoapods

Note that you need to have Ruby installed on your system to be able to use CocoaPods.
