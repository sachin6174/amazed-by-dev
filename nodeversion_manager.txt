Node Version Manager

nvm install 0.8
nvm use 0.8




3. Use the Latest Version:
To switch to the latest installed version of Node.js:
bash
Copy code
nvm use node

4. Check the Installed Node Version:
Once you've switched to the latest version, check the current Node.js version:
bash
Copy code
node -v





It seems that you're encountering an issue with nvm not being recognized in PowerShell. On Windows, nvm-windows might only work correctly in Command Prompt (cmd) but not in PowerShell.
Here's what you can do:
Run nvm commands in Command Prompt:
Open Command Prompt (not PowerShell) and run the nvm commands there.
For example:
bash
Copy code
nvm install 0.8
nvm use 0.8


Add nvm to PowerShell (optional but advanced step): If you prefer to use nvm in PowerShell, you can manually modify your environment variables:
Add nvm to Path:
Right-click on the Start Menu and choose System.
Click Advanced system settings and then Environment Variables.
In the System Variables section, find the Path variable, select it, and click Edit.
Add the path to where nvm is installed. By default, this should be:
bash
Copy code
C:\Program Files\nvm


Also, add the path for Node.js binaries (when nvm is using a specific Node.js version):
bash
Copy code
C:\Program Files\nodejs


Save the changes.
Restart PowerShell to apply the changes and try running nvm commands again.
Quick Solution:
If modifying environment variables seems too complicated for now, I suggest using Command Prompt (cmd) for nvm commands.
Would you prefer to use Command Prompt or set it up in PowerShell?
